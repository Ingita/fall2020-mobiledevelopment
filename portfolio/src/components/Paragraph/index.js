    <p>Hello! I am a senior at UCF. I am finishing my second major in Web Design and Social Platforms. I will graduate this Fall 2020. I am very excited about it. Currently, I am working part-time as a 3D artist. I create 3D assets for Cat5 Studios. At this moment, the company develops Intern Pursuit Game. I create 3D environments for them in Unity. I am passionate about designing realistic and magical environments. My second major is more like a hobbie to me. Maybe in the future, I will combine my knowledge in 3D and mobile development to experiment.</p>
